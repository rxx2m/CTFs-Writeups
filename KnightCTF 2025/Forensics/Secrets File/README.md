My friend's company's employees faced some attacks from hackers. Siam is a very close person to the company owner. Every employee knows that if Siam tells our CEO about anything, he can provide assistance without any hesitation. So, all employees made a statement, and here is the statement: "Triggers don't always require a spark. Sometimes, a simple change can set the stage for transformation. Where might such a trigger reside?" And guess whatâ€”the CEO granted him permission to hire an ethical hacker. So, he gave me that finding part. Are you able to help me with this issue?

Note: There are almost six users in their company, so anyone can be a victim. Thank you in advance.

Findout that One of the user hide some commercial data. Are you able to see that data?
