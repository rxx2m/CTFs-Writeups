The Genetic Cipher : 

In the not-so-distant future, a team of elite cryptographers and bioinformatics experts known as "The Genetic Guardians" has uncovered a chilling plot involving a rogue group called "The Alphabetical Order." This group aims to harness the power of synthetic biology and cryptography to develop a virus that can manipulate human DNA, encoding secret messages that could lead to chaos and global destabilization.

The Guardians discover that the rogue group has hidden vital information in a mysterious cipher-text that resembles DNA sequences, and they need your help to decipher it. The cipher-text is in the file:

The Guardians believe that the message is not just a mere jumble of letters; it is intentionally crafted to be deciphered alphabetically—each letter corresponds to a specific DNA base, and the decoding process is intricate and vital for unraveling the truth behind The Alphabetical Order's intentions.

As you embark on this challenge, you must employ your cryptographic skills to decode the sequence. But beware: hidden within the cipher-text are clues about the rogue group's plans, and each piece of information you uncover brings you closer to revealing their sinister agenda.

Your mission is clear:

1-Decode the DNA Sequence: Use your knowledge of genetic encoding to transform the cipher-text into a readable message.

2-Uncover the Hidden Clues: Pay attention to patterns, keywords, and anomalies that may give insights into The Alphabetical Order's next moves.

3- Save Humanity: The fate of the world may rest on your ability to decipher this message before it’s too late!
